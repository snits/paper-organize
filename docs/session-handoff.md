# Session Handoff: Day 3 Enhanced Download Features

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Day 2 Complete - Basic Download Functionality (Committed: 0f8655cc8bb8)
- **Basic download working**: `download_file(url, path) -> bool` function implemented and committed
- **Real HTTP testing**: Uses httpbin.org for integration tests  
- **Error handling**: HTTP errors, timeouts, file cleanup
- **Type annotations**: Full mypy compliance (0 errors)
- **Test coverage**: 13/13 tests passing including 5 download-specific tests
- **Directory creation**: Automatic parent directory creation
- **File cleanup**: Removes partial downloads on failure
- **Linting clean**: All ruff checks pass
- **Code reviewed**: Approved by code-reviewer for atomic commit

### üéØ Day 3 Session Goals

**Primary Objective**: Implement next atomic increment - choose one:

1. **Progress callback support** - Add callback interface for progress tracking
2. **Retry logic** - Add exponential backoff for network failures  
3. **CLI integration** - Connect download module to CLI interface

**Recommended approach**: Start with progress callback support as it's the foundation for user feedback

## Technical Implementation Details

### Working Code Structure
```python
# src/paperdl/download.py
def download_file(url: str, destination_path: str) -> bool:
    """Downloads file from URL to path with error handling."""
    # Uses pathlib.Path, requests with timeout=30
    # Creates parent directories, streams download
    # Cleans up partial files on failure
```

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Real HTTP download (httpbin.org/bytes/1024)
- ‚úÖ Mocked success/failure scenarios  
- ‚úÖ Network timeout handling
- ‚úÖ HTTP error responses (4xx/5xx)
- ‚úÖ Directory creation
- ‚ùå Advanced features (progress, retry) removed for atomic scope

## Commands for Next Session

### Quality Gate Commands
```bash
# Test suite (should pass)
uv run pytest

# Type checking (should pass) 
uv run mypy src/paperdl/

# Linting (76 errors to fix)
uv run ruff check src/ tests/ --statistics
uv run ruff check src/ tests/ --fix  # Auto-fix what's possible
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Install dev dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Run specific tests
uv run pytest tests/test_download.py -v

# Test CLI (should show placeholder)
uv run paper-dl https://example.com/test.pdf
```

## Atomic Commit Strategy

**Current atomic scope**: Basic HTTP download functionality only
- Function signature: `download_file(url: str, path: str) -> bool`
- No progress callbacks, no retry logic, no CLI integration
- Clean, testable, single responsibility

**Next atomic commits** (after linting cleanup):
1. Progress callback support
2. Retry logic for timeouts/server errors
3. CLI integration with download module
4. Progress bar display

## Files Modified This Session
- `src/paperdl/download.py` - Core implementation
- `tests/test_download.py` - Test suite (removed advanced feature tests)
- `pyproject.toml` - Added dev dependencies, ruff/mypy config
- `docs/development.md` - Development workflow guide
- `docs/project-structure.md` - Status updates

## Code-Reviewer Requirements Met
- ‚úÖ Functionality working with real HTTP endpoints
- ‚úÖ All existing tests passing (no regressions)
- ‚úÖ Type annotations complete
- ‚ùå Linting violations must be resolved before commit approval

**Recommendation**: Focus next session entirely on systematic linting cleanup using ruff auto-fix + manual fixes, then get code-reviewer approval for atomic commit.
