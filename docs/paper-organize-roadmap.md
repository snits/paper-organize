## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **PDF extraction failures**: Implement robust fallback to URL-based naming
- **Network timeouts**: Add configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Special characters**: Comprehensive filename sanitization
- **Permission errors**: Clear error messages with suggested solutions

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to "good enough" metadata - avoid perfect extraction
- **Overengineering**: Simple Python modules, avoid complex abstractions
- **Testing gaps**: Focus testing on real-world arXiv URLs

## Development Approach

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Core logic (naming, extraction, config)
- **Integration tests**: Full CLI commands with fixture URLs
- **Manual testing**: Real arXiv papers throughout development

### Quality Gates
- All tests pass before milestone completion
- Manual testing with 5+ different arXiv papers
- Code review of each milestone before proceeding

### Tools & Dependencies
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Package Manager**: uv (modern, fast Python package management)
- **Project Structure**: src/ layout for best practices
- **CLI**: Click framework
- **HTTP**: requests with retry logic
- **PDF**: PyPDF2 or pdfplumber
- **Config**: YAML support
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Version Control**: git
- **License**: MIT License

## Success Metrics
1. ✅ **Functionality**: Downloads and renames papers correctly 95%+ of the time (ACHIEVED - validated with real arXiv PDFs)
2. ✅ **Usability**: Single command covers 90% of use cases (ACHIEVED - auto-naming with opt-out)
3. ✅ **Reliability**: Handles network errors and edge cases gracefully (ACHIEVED - retry logic + graceful fallbacks)
4. ✅ **Performance**: Downloads complete in reasonable time with progress feedback (ACHIEVED - chunked downloads with callbacks)
5. ✅ **Quality**: Comprehensive test coverage and type safety (ACHIEVED - 74/74 tests, MyPy clean)
6. ✅ **Production Ready**: Metadata extraction with real-world validation (ACHIEVED - arXiv PDF processing)

### Milestone 4: Multi-Format Support (Future Enhancement)
**Goal**: Support additional academic document formats beyond PDF
**Status**: Future consideration based on user demand
**Priority**: Low (covers <5% of real-world academic papers)

**Tasks**:
1. **PostScript Support** (3-4 days) - See `docs/postscript-support-assessment.md`
   - Format detection based on URL and Content-Type headers
   - Basic .ps file download capability 
   - PostScript metadata extraction via ghostscript integration
   - Intelligent filename generation for PS documents
   - **Dependencies**: ghostscript binary + Python wrapper
   - **Complexity**: Medium (metadata extraction significantly harder than PDF)
   - **Value**: Low (legacy format, rarely used for modern papers)

2. **Future Format Considerations** (Research needed)
   - EPUB: Some academic publishers use this format
   - HTML/MHTML: Single-file academic papers  
   - arXiv source: Direct LaTeX/TeX file downloads
   - **Strategy**: Implement PostScript first as multi-format architecture prototype

**Implementation Notes**:
- PostScript support should be progressive enhancement (optional dependency)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing PDF-focused workflow
- Consider feature flag or explicit format specification for non-PDF files
- Test with legacy academic papers from 1990s-2000s era

**Success Criteria**:
- Download and basic naming for PostScript files
- Graceful degradation when ghostscript unavailable
- No regression in PDF functionality

## Testing & CI Enhancement Recommendations
**Goal**: Strengthen testing infrastructure and CI validation capabilities
**Status**: Recommended enhancements for production robustness

### Enhanced CI Integration Testing
- **Real PDF URL Testing**: Integrate tests with actual academic PDFs from arXiv, bioRxiv
- **Network Resilience Testing**: Add timeout, connection error, and retry logic validation
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Test across Windows, macOS, Linux environments
- **Python Version Matrix**: Validate across Python 3.8-3.13 versions
- **Performance Validation**: Add download speed and metadata extraction timing benchmarks

### Advanced Test Scenarios
- **Large File Handling**: Test with multi-MB academic papers (10MB+, 50MB+)
- **Unicode Metadata**: Validate international characters in author names and titles
- **Edge Case Validation**: Test malformed PDFs, corrupted downloads, interrupted transfers
- **Metadata Extraction Stress**: Test with 100+ different academic paper formats
- **Batch Processing Scale**: Validate directory processing with 500+ PDF files

### Quality Assurance Improvements
- **Test Coverage Enhancement**: Target 95%+ code coverage with branch testing
- **Security Testing**: Add dependency vulnerability scanning and security linting
- **Performance Regression Detection**: CI performance benchmarks with failure thresholds
- **Documentation Testing**: Validate README examples and CLI help accuracy
- **Integration Test Isolation**: Ensure tests don't interfere with each other

### Production Monitoring
- **Health Check Endpoints**: Add basic service health validation for production deployments
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Track and alert on extraction failure rates
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor average download times and processing speeds
- **User Feedback Loop**: Mechanism for reporting problematic papers that fail processing

## Post-Implementation Considerations
- **Future sources**: Architecture supports adding bioRxiv, SSRN, etc.
- **Batch processing**: Current design supports `xargs` for multiple URLs
- **Metadata improvement**: Can enhance extraction without breaking interface
- **Multi-format strategy**: PostScript as proof-of-concept for broader format support
