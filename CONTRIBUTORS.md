## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how you can help:

### Types of Contributions

- **Bug Reports**: Found an issue? Please report it with detailed steps to reproduce
- **Feature Requests**: Have an idea? Open an issue to discuss it
- **Code Contributions**: Bug fixes, new features, performance improvements
- **Documentation**: Improve README, add examples, fix typos
- **Testing**: Add test cases, improve test coverage
- **Dependencies**: Update or optimize dependency usage

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-fork-url>
   cd paper-dl
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   uv sync --extra dev
   ```

3. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make Changes**
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Ensure SPDX license headers are present

5. **Quality Gates** (All must pass)
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   uv run pytest
   
   # Type checking
   uv run mypy src/ tests/
   
   # Linting
   uv run ruff check src/ tests/
   ```

6. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Use atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
   - Follow format: `component: brief description`
   - Include `Co-developed-by: Your Name <email>` in commit message
   
7. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Ensure all CI checks pass

### Code Standards

- **Type Safety**: All code must have type annotations and pass MyPy
- **Testing**: New features require comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: Public APIs must be documented
- **SPDX Compliance**: All source files need `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` header
- **Code Quality**: Must pass Ruff linting with project configuration
